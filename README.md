# FM Radio Receiver 🎶📻

A simple FM Radio Receiver designed and implemented using electronic circuits 🔧📐.
It captures FM signals from local stations, demodulates them, and outputs clear audio 🎼🔊 — a practical project to learn radio frequency (RF) and communication systems 📡✨.

# ✨ Features

Receives FM signals in the 88–108 MHz band.

Demodulates FM signals into audible sound.

Outputs audio via speaker or headphone jack.

Compact, low-power, and easy to implement.

# 🛠️ Components Used

FM Tuner IC (e.g., TEA5767 / TDA7000 / CXA1619)

Antenna (Telescopic or Wire)

Audio Amplifier (e.g., LM386)

Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors (LC circuit for tuning)

Speaker / Earphones

Power supply (Battery/DC)

# ⚙️ Working

The antenna captures FM signals from nearby radio stations.

The tuner circuit selects the desired frequency.

The FM demodulator extracts audio signals from the carrier wave.

The amplifier boosts the audio signal and sends it to the speaker.

# 🚀 How to Build

Assemble the tuner circuit with FM IC and antenna.

Connect the demodulated output to the audio amplifier.

Attach a speaker/headphones for audio output.
